# askanai

## Overview

"Ask an AI" is pretty straightforward; This is a tool for asking an AI a question from the shell.
Currently uses OpenAI exclusively.

## Installation

Have your OpenAI API key handy

`bash install.sh`

## Usage

The parameters are stored in `.bash_profile`. 
The default model is `code-cushman-001`, which is tuned for fast code completion.

## Development

* I'd like to generalize this tool to arbitrary APIs.
